#Exercise 2.5 this programs finds the area, diameter and circumference of a circle

PI = 3.14159
radius = 2
diameter = 2 * radius
circumsference = 2 * PI * radius
area = PI * radius ** 2

print( 'the diameter is = ', diameter,'\n', 'the circumsference is =', circumsference,'\n','the araea is =', area)

#ques: in python can i just declare a variable without initiliazing it?
#how do i declare a constant?
